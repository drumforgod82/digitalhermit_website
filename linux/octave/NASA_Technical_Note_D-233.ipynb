    "# SUMMARY\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions are presented for relating the satellite position in the orbital plane with the projected latitude and longitude on a rotating earth surface.  An expression is also presented for determining the azimuth angle at a given burnout position on the basis of a selected passage position on the earth's surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples are presented of a satellite launched eastward and one launched westward, each passing over a selected position sometime after having completed three orbits.  Incremental changes from the desired latitude and longitude due to the earth's oblateness are included in the iteration for obtaining the azimuth angles of the two examples.  The results for both cases are then compared with those obtained from a com- puting program using an oblate rotating earth.  Changes from the selected latitude and longitude resulting from incremental changes from the burn- out azimuth angle and latitude are also analyzed.\n",

    "# INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "In the recovery of an artificial earth satellite it is necessary to bring the satellite over a preselected point above the earth from which the reentry is to be initiated.  It is the purpose of the present paper to determine the azimuth angle which must exist at a given burnout point in order to have the satellite vehicle pass over any particular earth position after a selected small number of orbital passes.  For this pur- pose equations are developed which give the latitude and longitude of a point on the surface of a rotating spherical earth directly under the satellite at any time.  An expression is developed which, with the orbit characteristics and the selected passage position on the earth's surface, will establish after only a few iterations the required azimuth angle at the burnout point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elliptical orbits about a rotating spherical earth are first assumed.  Although this simplification ignores the effects of the earth's oblateness,it is convenient to examine the oblateness effects later as incremental changes which can be accounted for in an iteration procedure. Departures from the desired latitude and longitude passage position resulting from incremental changes in the azimuth angle and latitude at burnout are also analyzed.\n",

    "If drag or accelerating forces acting parallel to the path of the satellite are neglected, the initial conditions of speed $ V_{1}$, radial distance $r_{1}$ and elevation angle $\\gamma_{1}$ at final-stage burnout determine the orbit characteristics of a satellite. It is the inclination angle of the orbital plane as determined by the azimuth angle $\\Psi_{1}$ at the burnout latitude $\\phi_{1}$, however, which determines the range of latitude that will be covered by the satellite. It should, therefore, be possible for a given value of VI, rl, and Yl to determine an initial azimuth\n",
